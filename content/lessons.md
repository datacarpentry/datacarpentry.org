## Materials in Early Development 

These materials are in early stages of development, and have not yet been incorporated into the official Data Carpentry lesson offerings. If you are interested in being involved in developing one of these lessons, see the information under each lesson description. If you are interested in developing a different curriculum, using The Carpentries lesson templates and pedagogical model, see our Curriculum Development Handbook for information about how to get started. If you are interested in contributing to the development of Data Carpentry lessons in general, visit the Help Wanted page on the Carpentries website to find a list of issues in need of attention.

### Economics Curriculum

A Data Carpentry curriculum for Economics is being developed by Dr. Miklos Koren at Central European University. These materials are being piloted locally. Development for these lessons has been supported by a grant from the Sloan Foundation/
